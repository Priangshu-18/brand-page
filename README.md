## About

This is a dynamic React-based website for Stride Shoes, designed to highlight our brand and showcase our latest shoe collections. The site is built using React for the frontend, with styled-components for styling, creating an interactive and visually appealing user experience.

## Note

- It is only a basic website having only home page and not navigation or any other pages because it was my first reactjs project.
- Keep all the images inside the public folder in the images section.
- Create a src folder and inside it paste all the .jsx files excluding the hero.jsx an navigation.jsx file.
- Put the hero.jsx and navigation.jsx file inside the components folder inside the src folder.
- Now run `npm i` and install all the dependencies and the in the terminal head over to the project folder and hit npm run dev to run the application.
- If you face any issues regarding the opening or running the application, feel free to contant me.

## Features

- Responsive navigation bar with brand logo
- Hero section
- Footer with quick links and social media icons
